# Project Repository  

## Goals  
This repository is created as part of my assignment. The main goals are:  
- To learn the basics of Data Analysis 
- To organize project files systematically  
- To maintain a structured and well-documented workflow  

## Naming System  
Files and folders will follow a structured naming convention:  
- `topic_version.ext` (e.g., `analysis_v1.py`)  
- Folders categorized based on tasks (e.g., `data/`, `scripts/`, `results/`)  
- Clear and meaningful names for easy identification  

## Repository Structure  
The repository will be organized as follows:  
- data/ → Stores datasets  
- scripts/ → Contains code files  
- results/ → Includes output files and reports  
- README.md → Provides an overview of the project  

## Additional Notes  
As I am new to the subject, this repository will be updated with my progress. Suggestions for improvement are always welcome.
